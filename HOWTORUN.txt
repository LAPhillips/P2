GAME PLAY:
This is a text based game. To play the game, open in an IDE and run the program
through the file "TaleOfNammu.java".

The game will walk the player through the game. You will be asked for your name
and which journey you want to go on. 

Journey options:
--Ceder Forest (Short)
--Mount Mashu (Medium)
--Salted Sea (Long)

Once you begin a journey, you will will have a specific number of encounters.
At each encounter, you may either be attacked by a creature (most likely), 
have a boon or have nothing happen at all.

To move between enounters you have to travel, however, before you travel, you
always have the option to 
--Look
--Check Stats
--End game

If you "Look", you will have an additional experience at your current encouter site.
You can possibly be healed, have nothing happen or get attacked again (small chance).

If you "Check Stats", the game will show you your stats.

If you "End the game", your journey will be ended and the game will be over.

To win the game, you have to reach the end of the journey alive. If you die before you
reach the end of the journey, you will lose the game.
